# mAB-Fuzzy-Match

The purpose of this particular script is to do a fuzzy match between some specific cases receiving monoclonal antibodies (or something, I'm not really clear on the details actually) and cases in CEDRS when the names and dates of birth don't match up. Tye Harlow is the one who asked me to do this, she knows. 

Anyway, there is some data that is not included in this repo because it's private and whatnot, so you'll need that if you want to do the match for yourself. It should be put in the subfolder "data".
